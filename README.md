# "Button size" game
This project is a fun web application where users have to try to click on a button.
However, the button **reduces** in size as the user moves the mouse closer to it.

**Disclaimer**: This *fun* project was created for launching on the web and is not intended to be used on mobile devices.

## Features

- The size of the button **change** when the mouse gets close to it.
- **Every time**.
- If you manage to click on the button, a **surprise** awaits you! *(maybe a second level...)*
